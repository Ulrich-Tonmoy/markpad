# Obsidian

A simple markdown editor.

Got the idea from [this electron app tutorial](https://youtu.be/t8ane4BDyC8) & [NoteMark Repo](https://github.com/gionathas/NoteMark). I added few additional features and used `Tauri` instead of `Electron` as i already had some idea about tauri from [this project](https://github.com/Ulrich-Tonmoy/codium) i'm still working on.

### Feature

- [x] Open a folder will load all `.md` files in that folder.
- [x] Create and Delete notes.
- [x] On App launch Open the last Opened folder.
- [ ] More MDX Editor Functionality
- [ ] Add Theming
- [ ] [Configure installer](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/building/windows)

### Technologies

- [x] Tauri
- [x] React
- [x] TypeScript
- [x] Tailwind CSS
- [x] Jotai
- [x] MDX Editor

This template should help get you started developing with Tauri, React and Typescript in Vite.
